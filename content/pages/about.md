## Our Story

The Accessible eStore is an iterative, interactive prototype of an e‑commerce storefront. It explores concepts in designing and developing for the web considering accessibility first. Web accessibility is more of a journey than a destination. In that spirit, this experience will evolve based on our continued learning and user feedback.

The web needs more examples of accessible and usable design and development. We tried to make our store's typical e‑commerce components keyboard and screen-reader accessible. We hope our work starts a conversation. We want it to lead to action that accelerates the creation of accessible and usable web experiences around the world. We want to enable everyone to fully participate in online activities and engage with their communities.

Creating our store was a tremendous undertaking. We began by providing screen reader training to our creative and technical teams. This is critical. You wouldn't ask someone who had never ridden a bike to design or build a bike. But every day designers and developers are asked to stretch in exactly this way. The vast majority of designers and developers are sighted mouse-pointer users. And yet they are tasked with creating experiences that will work with a keyboard and assistive technology. We wanted to teach people to ride bicycles before we asked them to design or build them.

We collaborated with and gained insights from our non-sighted colleagues. They helped us understand their major pain points in websites that are designed for people who can use a mouse.

We then unrolled a curriculum that we call the “Accessibility Deep Dive” sessions. Each session focused on accessibility best practices for a common e‑commerce website component. For example, the global navigation menu, the product listing grid, filters, and sorting mechanisms. We considered how each of these should work for people using assistive devices.

After everyone had enough context, we began creating the store one component at a time, via a series of hackathons. In each hackathon, we paired 2 user experience designers with 2 front end developers. Each team designed and built their assigned component or set of components within 4 hours. Post-hackathon, a front-end developer compiled the components into a page, and we engaged a visual designer to help us with polish.

Truly inclusive experiences require both thoughtful design and execution. We need to grow these skills in our creative and technical teams to finally arrive at a web that is truly accessible. The demand for this skillset is growing, but web accessibility compliance strategies are not taught in most schools.

We wanted to help enable the next generation of designers and developers to create accessible experiences. Creating the store helped our internal teams. We hope that by posting our work in progress online that we have created a resource for the world to use in order to explore this important topic.
